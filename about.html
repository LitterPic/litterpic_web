          Inspire Change At LitterPic Inc., our vision is bold and unwavering: a
          world free of litter. We refuse to accept a reality where trash
          litters our streets, pollutes our waterways, and endangers our
          wildlife. We believe that every person has the power to make a
          difference, and our mission is to inspire and empower individuals
          worldwide to act against litter. By uniting our efforts, we can create
          a cleaner, safer, and healthier planet for ourselves and future
          generations. At LitterPic, we're not just dreaming of a better world
          but actively working to make it a reality. We're harnessing the power
          of technology to connect people, facilitate litter cleanups, and share
          inspiring stories of individuals who are making a difference. In
          addition to our efforts to inspire and empower individuals to act
          against litter, we are also leveraging technology to make it easier
          for people to participate. Our team is developing a mobile app that
          will enable users to connect with other volunteers, organize litter
          cleanups, and share their progress and impact. Our long-term goal is
          to create a fleet of self-driving vacuum trucks that can efficiently
          and effectively clean up litter in even the busiest urban areas.
          Through the power of technology and community, we are determined to
          make our vision of a world free of litter a reality. Join us in the
          fight against litter, and together, we can create a cleaner, safer,
          and more beautiful planet for all.

            A software engineer by trade, I've been passionate about the
            environment ever since I can remember. I saw a need for a change,
            and this year decided to start LitterPic Inc. to make a difference
            and inspire others to lend a hand in cleaning litter from our roads,
            beaches, and parks!

            I love dogs and gardening. I aim to learn and practice sustainable
            gardening with no pesticides or fertilizer and plant flowers and
            vegetables native to our area. These small actions will help
            preserve our environment and sustain our pollinators, birds,
            butterflies, and bees! We need to take care of our planet, and we
            can make a difference, one step at a time!

            I enjoy cooking, baking, and seeing new places with my family. When
            driving to a new destination, first impressions are everything, and
            seeing trash on the road isn't fun. We like to repeat trips to areas
            that are taken care of and clean; it makes the experience more
            pleasant and unforgettable. I join LitterPic to make a difference,
            to make the destination clean!

          <p>
            As someone who has enjoyed the outdoors their entire life, I believe
            taking care of and preserving the environment around us is
            essential. If everyone does their part, we can keep this planet
            beautiful and help protect the land, water, and animal species that
            are in danger from pollution. If we all could do even a little bit
            now, we can make a difference for ourselves and future generations.
