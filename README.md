# LitterPic.com

LitterPic is a platform that aims to inspire and encourage individuals and communities to take action against littering. Our goal is to make a constructive difference by creating a better tomorrow for everyone. Join us in the fight against littering by sharing your stories and photos and inspire change.

## Getting Started

To start with LitterPic, pick a time and place you want to clean. You don't need to seek sponsorship from the city, but if you need any resources or support, feel free to contact them. You can also consult our Events Calendar for any local events already scheduled in your area.

It's always more enjoyable to pick with others! Spread the word by sharing your picking plans on social media. Reach out to local environmental groups to invite them to participate with you.

Stay safe by wearing fluorescent safety gear available at your local hardware store. You can also get your hands on our LitterPic branded fluorescent t-shirts and safety vests by donating to support the LitterPic initiative. Contact us via email to learn more about how you can score some branded merchandise.

Please take a picture before you start and then another after you finish, and post them on this site to share your efforts and inspire others to join the fight for a healthier, cleaner planet.
