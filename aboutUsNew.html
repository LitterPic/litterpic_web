      At LitterPic Inc., our vision is bold and unwavering: a world free of
      litter. We refuse to accept a reality where trash litters our <br />
      streets, pollutes our waterways, and endangers our wildlife.
      <br />
      <br />

      We believe that every person has the power to make a difference, and our
      mission is to inspire and empower individuals <br />
      worldwide to act against litter. By uniting our efforts, we can create a
      cleaner, safer, and healthier planet for ourselves and <br />
      future generations.
      <br />
      <br />

      At LitterPic, we're not just dreaming of a better world but actively
      working to make it a reality. We're harnessing the power of <br />
      technology to connect people, facilitate litter cleanups, and share
      inspiring stories of individuals who are making a <br />
      difference.
      <br />
      <br />

      In addition to our efforts to inspire and empower individuals to act
      against litter, we are also leveraging technology to make <br />
      it easier for people to participate. Our team is developing a mobile app
      that will enable users to connect with other volunteers, <br />
      organize litter cleanups, and share their progress and impact. Our
      long-term goal is to create a fleet of self-driving vacuum <br />
      trucks that can efficiently and effectively clean up litter in even the
      busiest urban areas.
      <br />
      <br />

      Through the power of technology and community, we are determined to make
      our vision of a world free of litter a reality. <br />
      Join us in the fight against litter, and together, we can create a
      cleaner, safer, and more beautiful planet for all.

              A software engineer by trade, I've been passionate about the
              environment ever since I can remember. I saw a need for a change,
              and this year decided to start LitterPic Inc. to make a difference
              and inspire others to lend a hand in cleaning litter from our
              roads, beaches, and parks!

              I love dogs and gardening. I aim to learn and practice sustainable
              gardening with no pesticides or fertilizer and plant flowers and
              vegetables native to our area. These small actions will help
              preserve our environment and sustain our pollinators, birds,
              butterflies, and bees! We need to take care of our planet, and we
              can make a difference, one step at a time!

              contribute to a sustainable future, and I am excited to join the

              I enjoy cooking, baking, and seeing new places with my family.
              When driving to a new destination, first impressions are
              everything, and seeing trash on the road isn't fun. We like to
              repeat trips to areas that are taken care of and clean; it makes
              the experience more pleasant and unforgettable. I join LitterPic
              to make a difference, to make the destination clean!

              As someone who has enjoyed the outdoors their entire life, I
              believe taking care of and preserving the environment around us is
              essential. If everyone does their part, we can keep this planet
              beautiful and help protect the land, water, and animal species
              that are in danger from pollution. If we all could do even a
              little bit now, we can make a difference for ourselves and future
              generations.
