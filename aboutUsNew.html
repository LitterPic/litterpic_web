    <h1>Inspire Change</h1>

    <h6>
      At LitterPic Inc., our vision is bold and unwavering: a world free of
      litter. We refuse to accept a reality where trash litters our <br />
      streets, pollutes our waterways, and endangers our wildlife.
      <br />
      <br />

      We believe that every person has the power to make a difference, and our
      mission is to inspire and empower individuals <br />
      worldwide to act against litter. By uniting our efforts, we can create a
      cleaner, safer, and healthier planet for ourselves and <br />
      future generations.
      <br />
      <br />

      At LitterPic, we're not just dreaming of a better world but actively
      working to make it a reality. We're harnessing the power of <br />
      technology to connect people, facilitate litter cleanups, and share
      inspiring stories of individuals who are making a <br />
      difference.
      <br />
      <br />

      In addition to our efforts to inspire and empower individuals to act
      against litter, we are also leveraging technology to make <br />
      it easier for people to participate. Our team is developing a mobile app
      that will enable users to connect with other volunteers, <br />
      organize litter cleanups, and share their progress and impact. Our
      long-term goal is to create a fleet of self-driving vacuum <br />
      trucks that can efficiently and effectively clean up litter in even the
      busiest urban areas.
      <br />
      <br />

      Through the power of technology and community, we are determined to make
      our vision of a world free of litter a reality. <br />
      Join us in the fight against litter, and together, we can create a
      cleaner, safer, and more beautiful planet for all.

        <h4>Alek Babich - President & Executive Director</h4>
        <p>
          A software engineer by trade, I've been passionate about the
          environment ever since I can remember. I saw a need <br />
          for a change, and this year decided to start LitterPic Inc. to make a
          difference and inspire others to lend a hand in <br />
          cleaning litter from our roads, beaches, and parks!

        <h4>Mel Tolman - Vice President</h4>
        <p>
          I love dogs and gardening. I aim to learn and practice sustainable
          gardening with no pesticides or fertilizer and plant <br />
          flowers and vegetables native to our area. These small actions will
          help preserve our environment and sustain our <br />
          pollinators, birds, butterflies, and bees! We need to take care of our
          planet, and we can make a difference, one step at a time!

        <h4>Sally Weiss - Secretary</h4>
        <p>
          As a native of beautiful Mount Desert Island, ME, I am passionate
          about the environment and keeping it healthy for <br />
          future generations. I believe that everybody must do their part to
          contribute to a sustainable future, and I am excited <br />
          to join the LitterPic initiative to help inspire others to do the
          same. Get outside!

        <h4>Jennifer Babich - Treasurer</h4>
        <p>
          I enjoy cooking, baking, and seeing new places with my family. When
          driving to a new destination, first impressions <br />
          are everything, and seeing trash on the road isn't fun. We like to
          repeat trips to areas that are taken care of <br />
          and clean; it makes the experience more pleasant and unforgettable. I
          join LitterPic to make a difference, to make the <br />
          destination clean!

        <h4>Jason Toussaint - Board Member</h4>
        <p>
          As someone who has enjoyed the outdoors their entire life, I believe
          taking care of and preserving the environment <br />
          around us is essential. If everyone does their part, we can keep this
          planet beautiful and help protect the land, water, <br />
          and animal species that are in danger from pollution. If we all could
          do even a little bit now, we can make a difference <br />
          for ourselves and future generations.
